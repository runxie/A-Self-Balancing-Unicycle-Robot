# A Self Balancing Unicycle Robot
#### Designed a mobile robot that balanced on a single wheel. It’s a complex automatic control problem of high order, multi-dimensional, nonlinear, strong coupling, under-actuated and absolutely unstable system.
#### •	Developed the PID control algorithm, multi-sensor fusion algorithm.
#### •	Implemented circuits design and conducted mechanical works.
#### •	Programmed in C.
